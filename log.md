# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I'm building a Markdown Previewer webapp. I created the React app using create-react-app, built out the file structure, and I was able to render markdown to HTML.

**Thoughts:** [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is awesome. Tomorrow I will look into using scss instead of css and start coding the React Components.
